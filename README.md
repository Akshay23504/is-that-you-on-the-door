### Is That You On The Door? - A Biometrics Project

Before we begin, this code will not work. Because there is no dataset here and the dataset is not pushed to the GitHub repository because of security and novelty reasons.

The aim of this project is to recognize a user from a door opening activity. Different machine learning algorithms are used to build and test the models. 

The applications for this problem statement are many including to catch burglars, identify family members when they enter their homes and identify employees in an organization.

#### Steps:
1. Collection of data using a smartwatch
2. Pre-processing the raw data (pre_process.py)
3. Feature identification and feature selection (feature_extraction.py)
4. Feature reduction (feature_reduction.py)
5. Feature reduction part 2 - where even more features are reduced using simple classifiers (feature_reduction_part_2.py)
6. Finally, run SVM and Naive Bayes on the final dataset and analyze the results
